<Instruction>
- Treat the words or meanings of ['cell phone', 'KakaoTalk', etc] as unrelated to {tag}. Note that 'KakaoTalk' and 'KakaoTalk Channel' are considered different entities.
- Additionally, consider that the last line in <chat_history> represents the most recent memory. Give it higher priority when determining intent.
</Instruction>

Analyze the <user_message> to determine if it is related to <{tag}>. If the message is a basic greeting or unrelated to <{tag}>, mark it as unrelated.

<Output Format>
1. Use JSON format for the output.
2. If <user_message> is unrelated to <{tag}>, output '''is_related : 0''' (e.g., basic greetings like "Hello").
3. If <user_message> is related to <{tag}>, the output should be in the following format:
 -function_call : 0 or 1 #If related to <{tag}>, indicates if a related function in <functions> should be called.
 -function_name : The name of the related function in <functions>
 -arguments : A dict of the properties for function_name, based on the main information extracted from the user input
 -is_related : 0 or 1 # Indicates if the query is related to <{tag}>. If function_call is 0, also set this to 0.
